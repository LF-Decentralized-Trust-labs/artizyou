        art_kind_text: "In Canada, it is possible to protect your artistic creations such as sculptures, drawings, or other objects. However, when the object created is manufactured in more than 50 copies, only the registration of an industrial design may allow protection. It is therefore possible to make a decorative pot in 10 copies for sale and hold copyright on this pot. However, if you sell 100 decorative pots, you will lose all rights to this creation in the absence of registration of an industrial design."
        invention_kind_text: "In Canada, and in most countries at the international level, an idea or an invention cannot be protected other than by the registration of a patent and / or an industrial design. The registration of your idea on the blockchain does not give you any protection against plagiarism by a third party and should be used by the Creator solely for compiling and preserving its innovation. For more details on how you can protect your idea or innovation, check out our FAQ."
        image_industrial_text: "In Canada, and in most countries at the international level, an industrial design may be protected only by registering the design with the appropriate government agency. The registration of your industrial design on the blockchain gives you no protection against plagiarism by a third party and should be used by the Creator solely for compiling and preserving his drawings. For more details on how you can protect your idea or innovation, check out our FAQ."

      modal_true_author_text: "Sometimes the author is not the true owner of the work. For example, when your employee created a work at your request during working hours, there is a legal presumption that the employer is the true owner of the work. However, it is very important to know that when the author of the work is a subcontractor or a freelancer, the rights in the work are deemed to belong to him and it is essential that an assignment agreement be signed between parties to ensure that you hold the rights to the work. Contact ArtizYou or check our FAQ for more details."
